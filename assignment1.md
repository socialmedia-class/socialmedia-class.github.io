Twitter's Language Mix <span class="text-muted">: Assignment 1</span> 
=============================================================

The second assignment will include using Twitter's streaming API, an off-the-shell language identification tool and (optional) data visualization.

##### 1. Get >=10k tweets from Twitter Streaming API following the instructions on [Twitter API tutorial](/twittertutorial.html) 

##### 2. and check:
- are all tweets LangID tagged (what %) by Twitter?
- how many different language tags provided by Twitter?

##### 3. then install/run [langid.py](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) and check:
- how many different language tagged?
- what % langid.py and Twitterâ€™s API agree/disagree?
- what kind of tweets/languages do they disagree?

##### 4. what about tweets in US?
- what % of tweets are geotagged?
- what % of different language of tweets posted from U.S.?

##### 5. (optional) draw some fancy plots 
- e.g. the language mix in Twitter like the ones in [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061981)
- R is a good package for plotting, [here](http://www.statmethods.net/) is a simpe guide of R.
