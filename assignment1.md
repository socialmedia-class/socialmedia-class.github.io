Twitter's Language Mix <span class="text-muted">: Assignment 1 (15 points)</span> 
=============================================================

(Due Sep 1st 02:00PM EDT; 20% penalty per day for late submission.)

This assignment includes using Twitter's streaming API, an off-the-shell language identification tool and data visualization. Some of the questions are open-ended, which means that there is no single best answer (do the best you can) and the grading will not be strict. 

##### 1. Get >=10k tweets from Twitter Streaming API following the instructions on [Twitter API tutorial](/twittertutorial.html) 

##### 2. and check:
- are all tweets LangID tagged (what %) by Twitter?
- how many different language tags provided by Twitter?
- what % is each language?

##### 3. then install/run [langid.py](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py) and check:
- how many different language tagged?
- what % langid.py and Twitter’s API agree/disagree?
- what kind of tweets/languages do they disagree?

##### 4. what about tweets in US?
- what % is each language?
- what % of tweets are geotagged?

##### 5. draw some fancy plots 
- For example, the language mix in Twitter like the Figure 5 and 7 in [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061981)
- Matplotlib is a Python package for plotting, [here](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) is a simpe guide of Matplotlib.
