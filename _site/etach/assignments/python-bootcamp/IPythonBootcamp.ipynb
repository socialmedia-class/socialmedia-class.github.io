      "This week we will start writing some code! This assignment is designed to be a crash-course to get you up to speed on the level of Python you will need to know in order to do the remainder of the assignments. For those of you that already know Python and are familiar with IPython's interface, great. You can skip to section 4. For those that do not, its easiest to learn by doing, so please start early so we can help you get on board. You want to spend the semester focusing on the crowdsourcing and machine learning, not the indenting and semicoloning. The only deliverable for this assignment will be your script, bootcamp.py. Running your script should print the answers to each of the questions in part 4 of the tutorial, separated by a single blank line. You will submit your code via turnin on the eniac machines. If you have not used turnin before, you can follow the instructions [here][turnin instructions].\n",

        "The usual Penfold's style - well made, and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance.\t***\n",
        "Dry, clean, nice piney (is that allowed?) spicy perhaps is better. Reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served. Decent length. Top\t**\n",
        "Honied - interesting green-tinged high-toned fruit. Bone-dry and rather nice. Time to drink though. Bare\t***\n",
        "Fresh, grassy, a bit vegetal. Fruity and a touch sweet. Top\t*\n",
        "Drier, quite intense. Hints at almonds and lime.\t**\n",

        "Sickly toffee-fudge nose. Sweet fruit. I don't like this.\t*\n",
        "Sweet soft-drink fruit. It expands a bit but I still find it too soft. For somebody who likes the style:\t***\n",
        "Quite sweet - very soft fruit. Herby and lifted. Decent\t*\n",
        "Still a bit soft for my palate - has Mt E always been this easy? Certainly the best of the three. Bare\t***\n",
        "Almost Madeira-like. It suffered a bit on serving - it was rather sedimenty. Pleasant but fading a bit.\t**\n",
        "Almost dry - nice, but no better than it should be given the reputation of the vintage.\t***\n",
        "Very classic cedary, mature Claret nose. Classic on the palate too, but there is an air of living dangerously, of corruption, and a general hint that the wine will crack up. Really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two.\t***\n",
        "Classic again on the nose, but a rather fresher, more stable palate with complex multi-faceted fruit. Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high-toned. Drinking well and no hurry to consume.\t****\n",
        "I don't get to try an awful lot of Bacchus nowadays, although way back I used to attend the English Wine Fair and try samples there. I can't say I miss it much. This wine is floral, grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon-like flavours. Strangely for a cleanly made 11% white wine, it isn't the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it's not unpleasant, just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds. Hopefully the Champagne style Pinot that was also sent will be more interesting.\t*\n",
        "Lovely fizz, with good nutty steely age on the palate. Fine depth of flavour, although the palate does tire very slightly at the end. Really on very good form.\t****\n",
        "Good fruit and depth of colour. Very obvious new oak on the palate. Good drinkable modern wine.\t***\n",
        "Fragrant, dry palate, quite meaty and serious. Time to drink I guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature. Rather enjoyable.\t***\n",
        "I don't often drink village Chablis. This is a good example of what you get from a good one: all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined. Best with food.\t**\n",
        "Quite tight and lean, I wondered a bit whether it wasn't a little thin when judged by the highest standards, but while not an absolute star, more and more emerged with some breathing. Very well-defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity. Excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage. Top\t***\n",
        "Lovely bright, crisp red fruits. Excellent concentration and balance, great fruit but bone dry. Just a lovely village wine, I thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that. Top\t***\n",
        "Top, top quality. Creamy fruit, lean, complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage.\t****\n",
        "Very good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage. Delicious. A good\t***\n",
        "Quite rich, forward, exotic fruit. Drinking nicely. This bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight, and then thawed - didn't seem to have done much damage, and as my host remarked it's an easy way of opening the bottle.\t**\n",
        "Pure, quite mineral, the fact that this is a \"no new oak\" wine very pleasingly evident. Quite a lot of richness to the fruit too, specially once it had been open for half an hour. Could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer. Nice wine. Bare\t***\n",
        "Understated, quite complex, but a little flat and dominated by a caramel/toffee overlay that I'm not keen on. Being a Tempier fan I was expecting a lot from this, but on this showing I'm not wildly keen.\t**\n",
        "Attractive and drinkable, but lacking the mineral complexity of the Launois NV drunk recently.\t***\n",
        "Pleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon. Bare\t***\n",
        "From a magnum (well it was New Year's Eve). I think I've had this bottle for five plus years. Lovely stuff - beautifully balanced. Could still have used a few more years. A very easy\t****\n",
        "Deep colour, very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms. Evolved. Quite bold and rich. Long and delicious, provided you like the meaty, not so elegant, Bollinger style - it's not everyones glass of bubbles. Top\t****\n",
        "Mineral, nice fruit, dry and taught. Starting to drink nicely. Bare\t****\n",
        "Deep colour, rather lovely, gentle, long, mellow, nutty and delightful. Some say a little lacking poise or complexity but I quite like it.\t***\n",
        "Pure, quite light and aetherial (the vineyard perhaps). Nice length and texture. Pleasingly little oak. Still improving but may be won't merit another star. Pretty good.\t***\n",
        "Dry, nice, savoury, but time to drink. Top\t***\n",
        "Colour tending to brown. Quite animal, rich and decadent - fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying.\t**\n",
        "Amazing dense young colour. Floral, mineral, tobacco. Iodine finish. Very fine indeed.\t*****\n",
        "Very easy, silky, forward. Touch of class. I would like to try this from a stronger vintage and with a bit of age.\t***\n",
        "Apricot fruit, creamy texture and flavour. No great complexity (typical of Eiswein). Lovely acidity. Bare\t****\n",
        "As it opens up, rather fine - raspberry fruit, touch of chocolate, a bit spirity towards the end. Moderate weight now. Top\t****\n",
        "Very fresh, lots of fizz. Touch of yeast, etc - a touch shorter and less weighty than the Bolly. In spectacularly good condition and with fine, precise bready flavours. Lovely Top\t****\n",
        "From a half. Its usual reliable self - fine bubbles and good medium-weight balance.\t***\n",
        "From a half. Simple and charming. I love claret like this, especially when the purpose of the evening is purely social rather than wine related. This is at peak and a pleasure to drink.\t***\n",
        "OK stuff with decent fruit. A touch coarse.\t**\n",
        "Beautiful. Especially after a bottle of indifferent Prosecco drunk with candied(?) hibiscus flowers in the glass. The Lynch-Bages is elegant, and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming. Hints of peach kernel and tempered steel.\t****\n",
        "Poor alongside the Lynch-Bages. Too soft and undemanding.\t***\n",
        "This needs a bit more time. Good structure and supple tannins - medium length. A good\t***\n",
        "Brought round by a friend for a Sunday lunch. A slight whiff of the farmyard when first opened, but this cleared to reveal a light-to-medium weight claret with classic cigar box.\t***\n",
        "Fruitcakey Claret, quite big and robust - seems a little woody at first but returning a day later it's clean, nicely-toned mature wine. Chunky and in the final analysis not that complex, but good.\t***\n",
        "Vanillan, lovely mousse, very elegant. Understated class.\t****\n",
        "Rich, good riesling character, quite a lot of residual sugar. Good in its way.\t***\n",
        "Lovely fresh fruit. Complex, delicate nose. Falls off a bit in the mouth. Opens out with some air and holds up well on returning after the other wines. This is one of their lesser wines - it's a credit to the property.\t***\n",
        "Rich, lively, smoky, very nice. Less fine than the Cubillo but richer. (From a half.)\t***\n",
        "Terribly refined, mature Claret. Great breed and balance. I sometimes find Pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes, but this is a super wine.\t****\n",
        "Nice old nose. A touch of tea - good but doesn't develop on the palate. Creamy vanilla. Just a bit rubbery but that becomes less noticeable as it opens in the glass.\t***\n",
        "Gamy,mineral yet edgy and unbalanced. Interesting yet also slightly flawed. Possibly a dodgy bottle. Top\t***\n",
        "Rich, limey fruit. Young-seeming. Apple finish. Excellent - marred ever so slightly by a raw woody background. Top\t***\n",
        "A touch pruney and hard - opens up a bit but remains a bit unsatifyingly remote. I would expect more.\t***\n",
        "Fresh, fragrant raspberry nose. Fine, elegany, light palate. Joyfully lovely.\t*****\n",
        "Elegant as always, silky-testured drinking wine. but I don't feel this has the power for long-term evolution that (say) the 1990 has. Drinking nicely now. Top\t***\n",
        "Drinking (from a half) really beautifully now. A delight.\t****\n",
        "I recall being a bit disappointed last time I drank one of these magnums. This one however is delightful, mature, berryish St Emilion. Breed and balance to the fore. Very good drinking. Top\t***\n",
        "Initially modern, rich, almost flashy. Later, gamy. Not sure what to make of this - it's not like the Vallana wines of old but it is quite substantial. Top\t**\n",
        "Pure, luscious. Not really a keeper on this showing. Top\t***\n",
        "Funky, showing age, substantial but odd.\t***\n",
        "Nicely integrated, a touch sweet and easy perhaps but high quality. Top\t***\n",
        "Clean, dry, attractive. Very drinkable.\t**\n",
        "Very pure, high-toned yet silky fruit. Somewhat in the Burgundian style but with roses, tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe Nebbiolo tannins. On the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old-fashioned Bordeaux. Doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well-made it is a pleasure to drink now. Top\t***\n",
        "Perhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit, quite dry-seeming now with a bit of Pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness. Pleasant enough.\t**\n",
        "Yeasty, quite meaty. Rich. Needs a few years. I haven't had a recently purchased bottle of Pol for a while and was surprised by its weight. Good though.\t***\n",
        "Iodine and iron, rich, decadent, fleshy. Fruitcake fruit. Good, and time to drink. Bare\t****\n",
        "Tight acidity, fine and intense. I've been a bit up-and-down about this wine but I'm sure I like this bottle. Perhaps even\t****\n",
        "Quite big, a touch flabby, rather evolved and vegetal. I'm not sure what combination of producer, vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this, being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case. Still pretty drinkable. Bare\t***\n",
        "Lightweight, feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food. Modest acidity, and so I am not sure how long this is for keeping. Very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level. Top\t***\n",
        "Not very striking.\t**\n",
        "Herby nose, quite tight and nicely balanced for the vintage.\t***\n",
        "Juicy, succulent, a touch of minerality. Very good: drinking but will probably improve a bit yet.\t***\n",
        "An attractive combionation of piquant high-toned fruit with a lovely rounded ripeness. Very good - for drinking over the next few years, I think. Top\t***\n",
        "(Domaine de la Bon Gran) Rather rich, touch of botrytis probably, pretty good.\t***\n",
        "Really nice - quite forward as the producers wines tend to be, quite big but in balance. No hint of the problems of the vintage. Top\t***\n",
        "The second bottle of H. Lignier 1er cru from this vintage I have tried recently. This is so pure, digestible and generally fine, but understated - it doesn't shout and it doesn't have a particular note of individuality for me. Yet it is a complete wine that I like a lot. Beginning to drink well, but not a long-haul wine. Top\t***\n",
        "Notably off-dry still, very fresh with rounded, attractive fruit. Good.\t***\n",
        "Lovely apple and cream nose, slightly honied and a touch of yeast. Fine mousse too. Lovely. A 93/94/95 blend I believe. Top\t****\n",
        "That old Rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely. Very fresh, nicely rounded fruit. Ultimately I suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good. Bare\t****\n",
        "Good intensity, the fruit has a distinct character: mineral, not fruit-driven, something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit. Very engaging. Top\t***\n",
        "Very gentle, completely resolved, pleasantly enjoyable.\t***\n",
        "All very lovely, but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques, I feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines.\t***\n",
        "An enigma: that slightly \"flat\" souuthern-French palate, but with air an engaging herby nose. Is it going anywhere? I'm not sure. Top\t**\n",
        "Lovely cherry fruit. Very attractive.\t***\n",
        "Good Syrah character, fruit-driven but not to the point of undrinkability. Pleasant. Scrapes\t**\n",
        "Substantial and weighty, notable botrytis, interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic. This was just a taste -I'd be interested to try more.\t***\n",
        "Fruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so I guess this is for drinking now. Creamy, some cigar-box, all in all attractive fruit, but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score. Top\t***\n",
        "I guess I could get used to this trocken business: this has good fruit and is bone-dry without being harsh. Still fairly moderate alcohol at 12%, the overall balance is good. A year or two short of its peak, I suspect.\t***\n",
        "Blackberry fruit, some oak I think - quite tannic perhaps from the oak. Modern-style.\t**\n",
        "An interesting expression of the Langhe, if with a modern tinge of new oak. Everything Conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception. On the other hand I can't feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his Barolos are. A mix of four grape varietoes including Nebbiolo. Bare\t***\n",
        "Round berry fruit, quite a lot of blackcurrant, some tobacco. Very nice mature Claret, if tending slightly towards the rustic - lacks the fineness of a top wine. Good though.\t***\n",
        "This is better every time I try it - class will out and I think it is Le Mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity. Delicious.\t****\n",
        "My last bottle of this. It's really a relaxed, fully mature, attractive and balanced wine. Enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that I remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance. Very good. I notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12.5% alcohol.\t***\n",
        "Very classy, pure, blackberry and apple fruit. Demanding but ripe tannins, very succulent. Really good Dolcetto.\t***\n",
        "Lovely bright appetising Mosel wine, yet with a rich fruitiness. Very attractive. Top\t***\n",
        "The second time I've tried this recently. It's an Ozzie-like Cabernet Syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate. Seems to get better the longer it is open. Fine wine.\t***\n",
        "A dry dark Oloroso-like palate - what a P.C. ought to have I guess but I often find them more Amontillado there too as well as on the nose. Rather good. 15 years old according to their web site. Top\t***\n",
        "Spicy riesling petrolly nose. Pretty dry - good length. But fairly simple and light.\t*\n",
        "Again petrolly - rather richer. Quite good concentration. Dry. I wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly.\t**\n",
        "Honey and caramel. Butter. Less intense on the palate. Good\t**\n",
        "Less ambitious and benefits from that - in fact reasonably concentrated and intense.\t***\n",
        "Unusually intense vanilla nose. Damp straw - quite heavy-textured.\t**\n",
        "Honied and rich. Charred nose and oily fruit. Big and long. Impressive in its way (which is not my way). Bare\t***\n",
        "Berry nose. Oddly rasping finish.\t**\n",
        "Minty. Similar - finishes a bit abruptly.\t**\n",
        "Minty. A bit toffeed. High-toned. I'm not wild about this.\t**\n",
        "Liquor blackberries. Medium-weight palate - oddly bitter finish. Might be going to be rather good. (I keep getting this wine in situations where I can't sit back,drink a couple of glasses and think about it. I must try and do that at some point.)\t***\n",
        "Dry, pure, well-made. Balanced.\t***\n",
        "Liquour raspberry again. A bit thick. Softer and lacking the attack of the 2001.\t**\n",
        "Hints at mint again. Oddly twisty. Yet more balanced than the Chileans.\t**\n",
        "Quite fresh, fruity, straw-like. High-toned. Rather nice.\t***\n",
        "Pleasant and gracefully old - perhaps going a bit flat. Top\t**\n",
        "Good fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire. Medium weight and with a hint of oxidation. Top\t***\n",
        "Rather simple after the de Venoge - lighter weight. Some complexity emerges after a while in the glass.\t***\n",
        "One of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special. Glorious sweet St Julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple. None of the \u0091typical Talbot whiff of the barnyard' that Broadbent notes, but rather, on this showing, a wine of great purity and lasting structure. Superb, and at a glorious peak.\t*****\n",
        "From magnum. I guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine (I rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order).

Good claret that, enjoyable though it is (I am drinking it whilst typing these notes), gets relegated, for now, to the luncheon division. A good\t***\n",

        "Pure black-cherry fruit in profusion. Good concentration and so on, with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines. How will this age I wonder? Probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste. Top\t***\n",

        "Meatier, longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak. Again so individual and so much a terroir wine. I love it. Bare\t****\n",

        "More awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance. But this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced. Intellectual wine and really good.\t*****\n",
        "More open and leafy, lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful.\t****\n",

        "Much more what one expects - plenty of acid, quite juicy, nice fruit.\t***\n",
        "I wasn't expecting much of this - Sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white Rhones. What a revelation though! Glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate. A wine I could drink and drink - and not just on Sundays.\t****\n",
        "Good old fizz with touches of honey, wood and aniseed. Medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together.\t****\n",

        "Not a star village, an un-rated vineyard and a moderate vintage - it's amazing what sensitive winemaking can achieve. Lovely, drinkable, engaging, characterful and not entirely simple fuit - nine years old and about at peak from a half. Really very enjoyable.\t***\n",
        "Dense colour. Quite Syrah-like at first, but more baked (almost burnt) plum fruit after a while. Good texture - feels nice in the mouth.

        "Healthy colour - cedary, fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate. Pretty much at peak, but holding nicely - a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too.

        "I haven't tasted this for eight years, I think. I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich, extravagently viscous texture. There's a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish.

This though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it's just a mistage to try and drink these wines young. Very top\t***\n",

It reminds me a bit of one or two other Italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction: Massa Vecchia and Gravner. It is rather less grand than either (and a bit cheaper) but I like it, and I think time is making it more interesting.\t***\n",

I could drink a lot of this, alas though this was my last bottle. A charming\t****\n",

Again, when I first took the cork out (a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night) a corky edge lurked within the wine. But it disappeared! As had the oxidised edge! The wine I am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay. Wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold (see the note for Pichon '92 below). But this wine seems to be living in reverse (if I left it another few days I'd probably end up with a bunch of grapes). Quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine (they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when I poured the last glass from the bottle). Scored as it is now drinking: top\t***\n",

This opens up with a little breathing and is really rather good. Top\t****\n",
        "Honey, yeast, apples - a complex nose and palate that repays attention. This still seems a bit tightly wound as yet.

(2001 plus reserve wines - disgorged June 2004 - I like the informative back-label). Very top\t***\n",
        "Rich nose - chocolate, yeast, dense fruit. Quite a weighty, vinous palate - perhaps a bit heavy at the moment and perhaps rather wood-influenced, but this might mellow with a year or two in bottle into something very fine. Might even rate another star in its way but for now\t***\n",

Floral and perhaps floury (or am I being influenced by the name of the grape) fruit, quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the mid-palate with an ordinary finish. Real Champagne balance (quite dry) makes it pretty drinkable however, although it is hard to find much real complexity. An oddity that is worth trying, particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like Moet NV, for instance. Scrapes\t***\n",

But nice though it is, I find it rather undemanding - no tautness, no succulence, in short no really grown-up qualities. I'd hope for more excitment from this vineyard. Still a fine drink, and it doesn't sell for huge money either.\t***\n",

        "And here's the coincidence. I just happened to drag this out of the racks in preparation for the same lunch.

Good maturing Burgundy.\t***\n",

Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones. Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don't find it remotely a problem. Very rich but now in perfect balance.\t****\n",
        "Quitelarge-framed, a bit coarse and difficult towards the finish - perhaps a year in bottle would help. Ok, but I'm not wild about this. From a half. Bare\t***\n",
        "Mainstream Chassagne. Pretty good.\t***\n",
        "A bit woody - extravagent oak as often with Grivot. Dry and austerely planky. I'm not so keen - others may like more.\t**\n",
        "Very pleasant gamy old thing. Drink soon. Bare\t***\n",
        "Rasins, a touch of oxidation, sweet pruney palate. OK but unremarkable.\t**\n",
        "Lightweight, almondy, quite fine. Picquant and medicinal. Attractive as a lunchtime port! A good\t***\n",
        "Elegant, lightweight, fresh and bright. Rather nice. Top\t***\n",
        "Very pale - the colour has dropped out as sediment. Madeira-like nose, pleasant port palate.\t**\n",
        "Quite pale, rather eveloved (the level is bottom-shoulder which might be the reason). Rather savoury and delicious but not quite what it ought to be, I feel. Top\t***\n",
        "Very pale, mushrooms and biscuits. Probably very old (some paper labels claim some of these bottles as 1850's - if any are, it's this one) and past its best.\t**\n",
        "From different source and showing up all the previous wines. Lovely graceful old wine, fruity and scented, still fresh. It develops in the glass and is completely delicious. Top\t*****\n",
        "Nutty, yeasty, lovely mature Champagne. Bare\t*****\n",
        "Quite forward, slightly fat 98 style. Completely healthy but for drinking. Top\t***\n",
        "Mineral, clear, fine. A stunning effort for the vintage. Top\t****\n",
        "Probably substantially North African! Bare\t***\n",
        "Lovely mature Claret. Perhaps even a bare\t****\n",
        "Gummy, quite intense, in-your-face stuff.\t**\n",
        "Rounded, very deeply coloured. Rather good. Top\t***\n",
        "Very rancio, cloudy (and still so the next day). Rich and thick and with something of Ozzie liquor Muscat about it. Curious. Top\t***\n",
        "Yeasty, very nice - Champagne quality although different in character.\t***\n",
        "Rather evolved - creamy marzipan. Very good but might have been better a few years ago. Top\t***\n",
        "Very much real wine, this oozes strength and individuality. Might well improve further. Very nice. Makes an interesting comparison with the Roda: I prefer this because its much less international. A good\t***\n",
        "Cassisy, peppery fruit. Rather international, but good of its sort.\t***\n",
        "Very classic, dry , tannic, high-toned. Top\t***\n",
        "Spicey, rich, very M-C.\t***\n",
        "Elegant, lovely balance. Class always tells. Bare\t****\n",
        "Very marmaladey, soft , delicious. I need to think more about this - is it Tokay somehow as it should be, or is it turned into something else for the modern market. I'm not sure yet, and I need to drink a couple of glasses more contemplatively. Still, it's at least very impressive.\t****\n",
        "I think I've had this for a few years. It's certainly worth keeping. Lovely honeyed and mineral palate. A joy. Just goes to show that you shouldn't rush drinking Champagne! Top\t***\n",
        "OK, but nothing out of the ordinary.\t**\n",
        "I haven't had Koonunga Hill for ages. I was pleasantly surprised. Very Penfolds in style (no bad thing to my mind) - velvety smooth, not trying to be too big, gentle on the head.\t***\n",
        "Good nose, but not typical. A really very coarse palate.\t*\n",
        "Rather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee - not very varietal now, more mineral - some will say too old but I think its at a peak. Pleasingly dry too - quite a fine wine. Is this just age or is this old-style Zind before the days of extra residual sugar? Whatever, it's rather nice. Top\t***\n",
        "Tarry, fragrant, everything you could want from a typical, good Barolo in a decent but not special vintage. Needs drinking in the next few years. Top\t***\n",
        "Rather deliciously smooth and fragrantly, softly Volnay. I noted after a while that this had been tarted up with quite a lot of new oak. Very good of its kind, and quite good even in absolute terms.\t***\n",
        "Lovely old-wine nose, fresh fruit. Coarsened after 30 minutes or so and faded a bit. Still rather pleasant. No indication on this half as to whether this was a Riserva or anything. Bare\t***\n",
        "Nicely made, fruity but not vulgar. Very drinkable. Bare\t**\n",
        "No excessive 2003 flab although I'd like a bit more precision and minerality. Decent wine.\t**\n",
        "Excellent fruit, especially given the vintage. Gamy and mineral. A lovely mouthful but the finish is a touch harsh. Still\t****\n",
        "Nice weight, attractive fruit but it seemed a bit flabby - maybe just a touch warm.\t***\n",
        "Creamy, fragrant, delicate, quite fine. Butterscotch background to greengage fruit. Completely fresh with a long finish. (Magnum)\t*****\n",
        "Excellent - tropical-edged very lemony fruit. Some oak I think. Nice balance and very rich. Big - a bit modern but very good. Aiming at the Beaucastel Rousanne VV style perhaps.\t***\n",
        "Very fizzy to the extent of being a fault. But it wears off enough to form a judgement - quite mineral and characterful. Serious wine that I'd like to try again. At least a good\t***\n",
        "Lovely, creamy, fine acidity, good length. Appetizing. Lovely.\t****\n",
        "Nice rich fruit, dry long. top\t***\n",
        "Still red Pinot Noir from Champagne. So soft and silky. Gorgeously round. Easy-going. One of the best non-Burgundian Pinots I have tasted. Top\t***\n",
        "Beetroot fruit - harder than the previous wines. Very baked and extracted. This is really not a success.\t**\n",
        "Lots of grippy tannins. Highly-wrought and oaky. Not my sort of thing - but striking. Certainly needs time but what will happen?\t***\n",
        "Very fine - deep, rich, silky with a lovely refined, dry palate. Splendid for vintage, but could one regret the lack of C-R typicity?\t*****\n",
        "Rich pineapple, nice acid. Very pleasant. Bare\t***\n",
        "Lighter at the final analysis - although more mouthfilling. Top\t**\n",
        "Acacia, nuts. Intense, dry, long. Drinking but no hurry.\t****\n",
        "Lime, herbs, cream. Not heavy on the palate - lovely. Top\t****\n",
        "Fragrant, piquant cranberry, yet meaty (bovril) nose. Excellent for the vintage. Partly on the basis of interest - a bare\t****\n",
        "Promoted conversation - apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an Australian wine is making a statement. A touch mineral, quite complex fruit - pure too and not overstated. Personally, I still find an overlying minty sweetness in the finish not to my taste although that might be less noticable with the right food. Interesting wine that somebody with more of a taste for Australian style might rate a bit more. Still\t***\n",
        "Fat, nice botrytis, a touch of paint-stripper and not so long. Good\t**\n",
        "Less intense, less flawed and follows through a bit better to the finish. Nice.\t***\n",
        "Lightweight yet concentrated. Ethereal, complex chocolatey fruit. Lovely.\t*****\n",
        "Earthy, fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla - good texture on the palate. My favourite of the three wines for drinking now.\t***\n",
        "Quite a soft wine - maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy I guess. Initially a bit dumb and subdued, but after time the wine opened out. It would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase. For now\t***\n",
        "Excellent condition at 10 years old, very good fruit too, although for some reason I could not get that excited about it. Still a decent\t***\n",
        "My last bottle of this - and hasn't it kept well. Completely fresh but fully mature, quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable.\t***\n",
        "Very juicy with a touch of Italianate bitterness to give it a grown-up appeal. Finishes a touch abruptly perhaps. A good\t*\n",
        "A glass at Valvona's Vincafe, even so clearly very elegant, refined, blanced and generally yummy.\t***\n",
        "Very classy, loads of fruit, fairly forward, drinking very nicely. Top\t***\n",
        "On opening, quite tough - you have to like tannins for this. It does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out. Delicious. Easy\t***\n",
        "Written from memory a day or two later: surprisingly old-fashioned orange-rimmed colour. Quite forward and easy-going, drinking OK at the moment in fact but surely more time can only improve matters. Very classy.\t***\n",
        "More forward and fragrant, not really noticably sweeter. Good\t***\n",
        "Curious - very exotic, vanillan, and highly vinous. Not everyones idea of Champagne, but you can't say it lacks character. I need to drink this over an evening (with food) and see how my relationship with it develops. For now a top\t***\n",
        "Dry, real Puligny, quite intense. Not special but it does what it says on the tin.\t***\n",
        "Quite rich, mouthfilling wine. Lacks the classic finesse that marks out the stars. Top\t***\n",
        "Nice fruit - pure, intense.\t***\n",
        "A bit more oaky - but quality fruit again.\t***\n",
        "Attractive green rim - never a bad sign. On the palate, like a really fine old Madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate. The flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink. Top\t***\n",
        "Chocolatey fruit - very nice old Colheita. Top\t***\n",
        "Possibly a touch too old now, but lovely old Champagne nonetheless. Mature and elegant for its depth.\t****\n",
        "One of the first wines I bought with a view to keeping. I love old white Burgundy, and this didn't let me down. Lovely, oily, nutty ethereal stuff.\t****\n",
        "Disappointing. Not past it, but just not particularly special. Maybe it still needs loads more time to develop?\t**\n",
        "Lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose. Drinking very well. Silky.\t*****\n",
        "OK, so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage. The label wasn't in the best condition. The next morning I was just sorting through the corks when I noticed we had really been drinking the 1982. The last time I had this wine I was disappointed, and I was again this time. It's OK, but it hasn't got the structure or depth expected.\t***\n",
        "Stylish nose, slightly resinous - a bit thin on the palate. Pleasant.\t*\n",
        "Slightly flat, flavoursome, a bit rustic. Interesting, up to a point.\t*\n",
        "Honied nose, strong palate. Quite evolved - ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years, I suspect. Even unflawed 96's seem to be aging quite quickly.\t****\n",
        "Open, peachy, luxurious. A little light, some thought, but I loved it.\t****\n",
        "Grenachey, cassis overtones - quite raw finish. A bit rubbery.\t**\n",
        "Caramel nose. A touch rough, perhaps. Opens out - quite classically chateauneuf. Top\t***\n",
        "Nice balance, clearly warm-vintage. A lovely balance of slavours. Coming round to drinking quite fast. A good\t****\n",
        "Yummy drinkability. Stands up in this company - if a bit simple.\t***\n",
        "Fragrant nose. Gummy, rich, very fine.\t****\n",
        "A touch woody. Pleasant, persistent, but perhaps a bit thin. Bare\t***\n",
        "Burnt, a bit thin. Bare\t**\n",
        "Fragrant fruit, a touch hard, a touch of aniseed. fairly lightweight. Top\t***\n",
        "My memory of vintages of this Provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good: Provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box. Very much a point and it has kept well. A little simple perhaps but I believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property. Good effort - I'd like to try some other vintages.\t***\n",
        "Quite concentrated and flavoursome, but lacking finesse for me in a way that I'm not sure more time will alleviate. PLeasant then but not fantastic.\t***\n",
        "Smoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable.\t***\n",
        "Blackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours, very stylish indeed. Will probably improve for a year or two.\t***\n",
        "A bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains. Still, quite a dense, brown-sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something. Good rather than exceptional.\t***\n",
        "Fruity, grassy - like a new world semillon. Pleasant enough.\t*\n",
        "Nice fruit quality - quite suave. Decent length. Top\t*\n",
        "Very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay. Very refined texture and good length. Once it has been open a while it seems even more Burgundian. It needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding. Scrapes\t****\n",
        "Slate, sherbert, a touch sour as MSR wines can be. Good length, maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something I find occasionally with the vintage. Fine, but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain. Top\t***\n",
        "Modern-styled, but very nicely done. Limey acidity. Satisfying, but completely upstaged by the Jobard that follows.\t***\n",
        "Softer and rounder than the Lafarge below. Still quite piquant on the palate.\t***\n",
        "Dry, fragrant, good length. Fairly austere at first and less flattering than the Jadot wine. Might till improve touch, while the Jadot is ready.\t***\n",
        "Open 24 hours. Seems good. Quite mineral.\t***\n",
        "Good strawberry nose and pleasantly elegant palate.\t***\n",
        "Drinkable.\t*\n",
        "Rich, quite forward (sepcially for the vintage), the quality shows in the persistence. Lovely Juniper/Gin edge to the nose.\t****\n",
        "A belnd of 95 and 96. Strawberry fruit, impressive at first but it does seem simple compared to the Deutz. Weighty but not so intense. Good though for the price.\t***\n",
        "Quite varietal but with an added complexity and some non-fruit chatracter that makes it stand out. Drinking very nicely. Top\t***\n",
        "Lighter and a touch vegetal. A touch thin but nevertheless it is a wine of character. Top\t**\n",
        "Richer again, as with the 93 you might struggle to spot the grape variety: no bad thing in my mind. An interesting mature wine\t***\n",
        "Very fine, very characteristically Southern Rhone. Top\t***\n",
        "Really quite Northern Rhone-like and very stylish, gamy Syrah.\t****\n",
        "Very complex, smoky wine. Really lovely. Scrapes\t*****\n",
        "Gamy but elegant. A little overawed by the Rayas wines, but fine. Bare\t****\n",
        "Balanced and rich, but perhaps not showing ideally now. A little more time might help. Still\t****\n",
        "Very creamy but not rich. Dies a bit in the glass. Interesting, and pretty good for an average vintage, vineyard, etc. Top\t**\n",
        "Difficult on opening - gamy almost and austere. Opens out nicely. Top\t***\n",
