Survey a Social Media Platform or a NLP Research Group <span class="text-muted">: In-class Presentation (20 points)</span> 
=============================================================

You will pair together (2 students) and give a 8-minute presentation (plus 2-minute Q&A) in class on a social media platform or a NLP research group of your choice. 


First, please **[sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-m8OURTxmXSNRbkzXTg4-Air_tZ0WwPSdbM4YpZ-rs/edit?usp=sharing)** to pick a date you want to present, and pick a social media platform (a list [here](http://www.ovrdrv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Social-Media-Map-2016.pdf)) or a NLP research group (a list [here](https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-best-schools-for-studying-natural-language-processing)). 

Second, after your presentation in the class, **upload your slides** to [OSU's Carmen](https://carmen.osu.edu/) system. Your slides will be also published on this course website. 



#### For social media platforms, you may focus on:

- Market: When it was founded, purchased, and etc?
- Interface: How people use it, and why?
- Software Development: Any API available?
- Academic Research: Any interesting studies? Any useful datasets?
- and any other things you think are important


#### For NLP research groups, you may focus on:

- Who? What are the prominent researchers, famous students or alumni?
- What do they do? What research topics they are working on?
- Any interesting or notable paper(s) that worth mentioning?
- and any other things you think are important
