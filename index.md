Social media provides a massive amount of valuable information and shows us how language is actually used by lots of people. This course will give an overview of prominent research findings on language use in social media. The course will also cover several machine learning algorithms and the core natural language processing techniques for obtaining and processing Twitter data.


Instructor
: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Wei Xu](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xwe/) will be starting as an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University in fall 2016. She is currently a post-doctoral researcher in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research lies at the intersections of machine learning, natural language processing, and social media. She has received her PhD in 2014 from New York University. She is organizing the ACL/COLING [Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text](http://noisy-text.github.io/). She  a workshop co-chair for ACL 2017, an area chair for EMNLP 2016 and the publicity chair for NAACL 2016.

**<font color='red'>This regular course will be significantly more challenging than the summer version that is currently on this website!</font>** <br>  **Prerequisites** In order to succeed in this course, you should be comfortable with probability and statistics. You must know what the chain rule of probability is, and Bayes' rule. On the programming side, all projects will be in Python. You should understand basic computer science concepts (like recursion), basic data structures (trees, graphs), and basic algorithms (search, sorting, etc).
